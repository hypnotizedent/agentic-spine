# AOF Alignment Audit: fixtures/

**Audit Date:** 2026-02-16T16:39:00
**Target Folder:** `/Users/ronnyworks/code/agentic-spine/fixtures`
**Total Files:** 56
**Total Size:** 440KB
**Auditor:** Sisyphus (automated)

---

## Executive Summary

The `fixtures/` folder contains a mix of **runtime test assets** (events, baselines) and **external workflow definitions** (n8n exports). Per AOF governance:

- **Spine** = runtime authority for governed operations, capabilities, receipts
- **Workbench** = tooling, compose configs, agent implementations, workflow definitions

**Primary Finding:** The `n8n/` subfolder contains 36 n8n workflow JSON files that belong in workbench per `COMPOSE_AUTHORITY.md` and `AGENTS_LOCATION.md`. These are workflow definitions, not runtime fixtures.

---

## Section 1: KEEP_SPINE

Files that are correctly placed in the spine runtime as governed test/fixture assets.

| Path | Count | Reason |
|------|-------|--------|
| `/Users/ronnyworks/code/agentic-spine/fixtures/events/v1/` | 9 files (8 events + SCHEMA.md) | Deterministic replay fixtures for `spine.replay` capability. Used at runtime by spine verify gates. |
| `/Users/ronnyworks/code/agentic-spine/fixtures/baseline/` | 6 files (5 hashes + README.md) | SHA256 baseline hashes for replay verification. Runtime test surface. |
| `/Users/ronnyworks/code/agentic-spine/fixtures/tenant.sample.yaml` | 1 file | Sample AOF tenant profile for `tenant.profile.validate` capability. Configuration template. |
| `/Users/ronnyworks/code/agentic-spine/fixtures/README.md` | 1 file | Folder documentation (canonical spine doc). |
| `/Users/ronnyworks/code/agentic-spine/fixtures/INDEX.md` | 1 file | Fixture inventory (canonical spine doc). |

**Total KEEP_SPINE:** 18 files (~10KB)

**Rationale:** These files are:
1. Consumed by spine capabilities (`spine.replay`, `tenant.profile.validate`)
2. Part of the deterministic verification surface
3. Configuration templates for spine runtime

---

## Section 2: MOVE_WORKBENCH

Files that should be relocated to workbench per AOF governance.

| Path | Count | Size | Target Location |
|------|-------|------|-----------------|
| `/Users/ronnyworks/code/agentic-spine/fixtures/n8n/snapshots/20260216-112351/` | 35 JSON files | ~420KB | `/Users/ronnyworks/code/workbench/infra/compose/n8n/workflows/snapshots/` |
| `/Users/ronnyworks/code/agentic-spine/fixtures/n8n/Spine_-_Mailroom_Enqueue.json` | 1 JSON file | ~4KB | `/Users/ronnyworks/code/workbench/infra/compose/n8n/workflows/` |
| `/Users/ronnyworks/code/agentic-spine/fixtures/n8n/README.md` | 1 file | ~1KB | Can stay (documents spine-specific integration) or merge into workbench doc |

**Total MOVE_WORKBENCH:** 37 files (~425KB)

### Governance Violations

**D121 - Fabric Boundary Lock (from `docs/governance/VERIFY_SURFACE_INDEX.md`):**
> "Lean-spine boundary lock (domain capability freeze + active workbench implementation paths)"

n8n workflows are domain implementation assets, not spine runtime assets.

**COMPOSE_AUTHORITY.md (lines 46-47):**
```
| n8n | `/Users/ronnyworks/code/workbench/infra/compose/n8n/docker-compose.yml` |
```

**MAILROOM_RUNBOOK.md (lines 346-348):**
> "The mailroom (spine) and n8n (workbench) are architecturally decoupled:
> - n8n workflows and compose live in `workbench/infra/compose/n8n/` — they are workbench-owned"

**Observed State:** Workbench already contains the canonical n8n workflows at:
`/Users/ronnyworks/code/workbench/infra/compose/n8n/workflows/`

The `fixtures/n8n/snapshots/` folder contains duplicates of these workflows (same workflow names, different file naming convention with IDs).

---

## Section 3: RUNTIME_ONLY

No files identified in this category.

Runtime-only content would be generated logs, state files, or receipts that should not be versioned. The fixtures folder does not contain such content.

---

## Section 4: UNKNOWN

No files identified in this category.

All files in `fixtures/` have clear purposes documented via README.md and INDEX.md.

## Top 10 Highest-Risk Mismatches

| Rank | File/Path | Risk Level | Issue | Remediation |
|------|-----------|------------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | `/Users/ronnyworks/code/agentic-spine/fixtures/n8n/snapshots/20260216-112351/` (35 files) | **HIGH** | n8n workflow exports belong in workbench per COMPOSE_AUTHORITY.md; duplicates workbench workflows; violates lean-spine principle | Move entire `n8n/` folder to workbench; update `fixtures/n8n/README.md` to point to workbench location |
| 2 | `/Users/ronnyworks/code/agentic-spine/fixtures/n8n/Spine_-_Mailroom_Enqueue.json` | **MEDIUM** | Spine-specific integration workflow but still an n8n workflow definition; governance says all n8n workflows live in workbench | Move to `workbench/infra/compose/n8n/workflows/`; spine can reference it |
| 3 | `.DS_Store` in fixtures root | **LOW** | macOS artifact should not be versioned | Add to `.gitignore` and remove |

---

## Remediation Plan

### Phase 1: Move n8n content (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Create target in workbench
mkdir -p /Users/ronnyworks/code/workbench/infra/compose/n8n/workflows/snapshots

# 2. Move snapshots
mv /Users/ronnyworks/code/agentic-spine/fixtures/n8n/snapshots/20260216-112351 \
   /Users/ronnyworks/code/workbench/infra/compose/n8n/workflows/snapshots/

# 3. Move main workflow
mv /Users/ronnyworks/code/agentic-spine/fixtures/n8n/Spine_-_Mailroom_Enqueue.json \
   /Users/ronnyworks/code/workbench/infra/compose/n8n/workflows/

# 4. Update fixtures/n8n/README.md to point to workbench
# 5. Remove empty fixtures/n8n/snapshots/ folder
# 6. Commit with: gov(D121): move n8n workflows from fixtures to workbench
```

### Phase 2: Update Documentation

1. Update `fixtures/INDEX.md` to remove n8n references or mark as "see workbench"
2. Update `fixtures/n8n/README.md` to be a pointer-only surface to workbench

### Phase 3: Cleanup

```bash
# Remove .DS_Store
rm /Users/ronnyworks/code/agentic-spine/fixtures/.DS_Store

# Add to .gitignore if not present
echo "fixtures/.DS_Store" >> /Users/ronnyworks/code/agentic-spine/.gitignore
```
