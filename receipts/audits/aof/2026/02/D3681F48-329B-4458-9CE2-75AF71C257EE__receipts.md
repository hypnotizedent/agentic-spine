# AOF Alignment Audit: receipts/

**Terminal ID:** D3681F48-329B-4458-9CE2-75AF71C257EE  
**Date:** 2026-02-16  
**Target:** `/Users/ronnyworks/code/agentic-spine/receipts`  
**Size:** 95MB | **Files:** 22,332 | **Tracked in Git:** 6

## Executive Summary

The `receipts/` folder is **mostly aligned** with AOF conventions. The canonical `sessions/` subfolder is correctly configured as the governed receipt location per `AGENTS.md` and `SESSION_PROTOCOL.md`. However, the `audits/` subfolder contains **host-specific artifacts** (launchagent plists, backup logs) that violate the spine/workbench boundary, and a `workbench/` folder exists that creates naming confusion.

---

## KEEP_SPINE (Canonical Spine Content)

| Path | Files | Reason |
|------|-------|--------|
| `/Users/ronnyworks/code/agentic-spine/receipts/sessions/` | 22,022 | **Canonical receipt location** per SESSION_PROTOCOL.md. Contains RCAP-* capability execution receipts (receipt.md + output.txt). Properly gitignored. |
| `/Users/ronnyworks/code/agentic-spine/receipts/dr/` | 1 | **DR certification receipts** - governed spine content for disaster recovery attestation. Tracked. |
| `/Users/ronnyworks/code/agentic-spine/receipts/audits/*.md` | 9 | **Audit trace documents** - spine-native audit receipts (MEDIA_STACK_E2E_TRACE, HOME_DRIFT_TRACE, etc.) |

**Total KEEP_SPINE:** 22,032 files

---

## MOVE_WORKBENCH (Host-Specific Artifacts)

| Path | Files | Reason | Recommended Destination |
|------|-------|--------|------------------------|
| `/Users/ronnyworks/code/agentic-spine/receipts/audits/launchagent_backups_20260202-201328/` | 4 | **LaunchAgent plist backups** - host-specific macOS configuration that belongs in workbench dotfiles, not spine receipts | `~/code/workbench/dotfiles/launchagents/archive/` |

**Total MOVE_WORKBENCH:** 4 files

---

## RUNTIME_ONLY (Gitignored Runtime Artifacts)

| Path | Files | Reason | Action |
|------|-------|--------|--------|
| `/Users/ronnyworks/code/agentic-spine/receipts/audits/_archived_logs_20260202-201328/` | 3 | **Backup log files** (vaultwarden-backup-*.log) - runtime artifacts that should not be stored in spine | Delete (already gitignored) |
| `/Users/ronnyworks/code/agentic-spine/receipts/.DS_Store` | 1 | macOS artifact | Delete |
| `/Users/ronnyworks/code/agentic-spine/receipts/audits/_archived_agent_20260202-201328/.DS_Store` | 1 | macOS artifact | Delete |

**Total RUNTIME_ONLY:** 5 files

---

## UNKNOWN (Ambiguous Placement)

| Path | Files | Reason | Recommendation |
|------|-------|--------|----------------|
| `/Users/ronnyworks/code/agentic-spine/receipts/workbench/WORKBENCH_ESTATE_GREEN_2026-02-04_0004.md` | 1 | **Workbench content in spine receipts** - creates naming confusion. This is tracked in git. | Move to `receipts/audits/` if it's a spine audit, or to `~/code/workbench/docs/receipts/` if it's workbench-native |
| `/Users/ronnyworks/code/agentic-spine/receipts/audits/_archived_agent_20260202-201328/outbox/` | 3 | **Archived agent outbox reports** - historical reports from Feb 2026. Could be retained or archived | Evaluate retention policy; consider moving to `docs/governance/_audits/` if still relevant |

**Total UNKNOWN:** 4 files

## Top 10 Highest-Risk Mismatches

| Rank | Risk | Path | Issue | Impact |
|------|------|------|-------|--------|
| 1 | **HIGH** | `receipts/audits/launchagent_backups_20260202-201328/*.plist` | Host-specific plists in spine repo | Violates workbench contract; plists should live in `workbench/dotfiles/` |
| 2 | **HIGH** | `receipts/audits/_archived_logs_20260202-201328/*.log` | Backup logs in spine receipts | Runtime artifacts polluting receipt namespace |
| 3 | **MEDIUM** | `receipts/workbench/` folder | Workbench-named folder in spine | Creates confusion about authority; implies workbench content lives in spine |
| 4 | **MEDIUM** | `receipts/audits/_archived_agent_20260202-201328/` | Archived agent work in receipts | Receipts should be capability outputs, not archival storage |
| 5 | **LOW** | `receipts/.DS_Store` | macOS artifact | Should be in global gitignore |
| 6 | **LOW** | `receipts/audits/.DS_Store` | macOS artifact | Should be in global gitignore |
| 7 | **INFO** | `receipts/sessions/` gitignored but 1 ADHOC tracked | Inconsistent tracking | `ADHOC_20260209_160037_UDR6_CUTOVER_P2` is tracked but sessions folder is gitignored |
| 8 | **INFO** | Mixed content in `receipts/audits/` | Audit traces + backups + logs | Single folder serving multiple purposes |
| 9 | **INFO** | No retention policy evident | 22K+ session receipts | May need cleanup policy for old receipts |
| 10 | **INFO** | `receipts/audits/` gitignored entirely | Audit traces not tracked | `receipts/audits/*.md` files are valuable audit history but not versioned |

## Recommended Actions

1. **Immediate:**
   - Delete `.DS_Store` files
   - Delete `receipts/audits/_archived_logs_20260202-201328/` (runtime logs)

2. **Short-term:**
   - Move `receipts/audits/launchagent_backups_20260202-201328/` to `~/code/workbench/dotfiles/launchagents/archive/`
   - Rename or relocate `receipts/workbench/` folder

3. **Policy:**
   - Define retention policy for `receipts/sessions/` (e.g., 90-day rolling window)
   - Consider promoting valuable audit traces (`receipts/audits/*.md`) to `docs/governance/_audits/` for versioning
