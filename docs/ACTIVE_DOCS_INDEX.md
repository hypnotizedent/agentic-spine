# Active Docs Index (MERGED)

This human-readable index has been superseded by the machine-readable registry.

**Replacement:** `docs/governance/_index.yaml` (105-doc master registry)
**Human-readable navigation:** `docs/governance/GOVERNANCE_INDEX.md`

The YAML registry is the canonical source for document metadata (type, purpose, scope).
