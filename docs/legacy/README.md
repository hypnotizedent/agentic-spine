# Legacy references (non-authoritative)

This folder contains documentation that references **ronny-ops** for historical context only.

**Rules:**
- ronny-ops is LEGACY and must never become runtime authority.
- agentic-spine is the only authority for protocols, gates, capabilities, and orchestration.
- New work must not depend on ronny-ops scripts or paths.

If a legacy doc is needed, extract *invariants only* into `docs/core/`.
