Deprecated: `mint ask` is no longer a supported query path.

Use SSOT docs and repo search instead:
- `docs/governance/GOVERNANCE_INDEX.md`
- `docs/governance/SSOT_REGISTRY.yaml`
- `rg -n "<query>" docs ops`

Use this BEFORE guessing about:
- How features work
- Schema definitions
- What failed before
- Deployment procedures
