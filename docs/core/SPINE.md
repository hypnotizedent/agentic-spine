# Agentic Spine (Detachable)

> **Status:** authoritative
> **Last verified:** 2026-02-04

Core is intentionally small:
1) `spine doctor`   -> prints truth (green/red)
2) `spine start`    -> creates a RUN_ID + run folder
3) `spine run`      -> executes exactly one task file
4) `spine receipt`  -> writes proof
5) `spine closeout` -> finalizes run

Everything else is a plugin.
