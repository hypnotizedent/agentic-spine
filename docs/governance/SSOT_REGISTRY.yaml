# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Validation Rules
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# 1. Every SSOT must have front-matter with:
#    status: authoritative
#    owner: "@ronny"
#    last_verified: YYYY-MM-DD
#
# 2. SSOTs must be in this registry to be recognized as
#    DOMAIN-LEVEL truth sources (single source of truth for a scope).
#
# 3. If a doc claims SSOT but isn't here, either:
#    - Add it to this registry, OR
#    - Remove the SSOT claim from the doc
#
# 4. Review cycle: Monthly (or after major changes)
#
# NOTE on `status: authoritative` vs SSOT registration:
#   Many governance docs use `status: authoritative` to mark them as the
#   canonical version of their content (runbooks, policies, backup procedures).
#   This does NOT require SSOT registration. Only docs that define domain-level
#   truth (e.g., "where do services run?" or "what devices exist?") need entries.
#   Operational docs (backup/restore runbooks, policies, authority declarations)
#   are correctly authoritative without being SSOTs.
#   Decision: LOOP-SSOT-REGISTRY-COVERAGE-CLEANUP-20260210 (2026-02-10).
