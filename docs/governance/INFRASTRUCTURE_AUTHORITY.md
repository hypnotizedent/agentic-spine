# ⚠️ DEPRECATED

**This document was deprecated on 2026-01-25.**

## Canonical Replacement

→ **[SERVICE_REGISTRY.yaml](SERVICE_REGISTRY.yaml)** (spine-native)

## Why

This file duplicated content that already existed in SERVICE_REGISTRY.yaml (registered SSOT, Priority 1). During governance cleanup, all infrastructure authority was consolidated there.

## Do Not

- Edit this file
- Reference this file
- Create new content here

All infrastructure configuration lives in SERVICE_REGISTRY.yaml.
