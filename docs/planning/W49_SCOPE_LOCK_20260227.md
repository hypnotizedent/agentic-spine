## Purpose
- Lock tonight's orchestration scope for lifecycle-driven nightly closeout work.
- Enforce strict no-touch protection for active runtime lanes and protected reconciliation items.

## In Scope
- Governance and repository lifecycle wiring for `nightly.closeout`.
- Deterministic dry-run + apply closeout flow with receipts.
- Non-destructive-first cleanup and reconciliation for non-protected stale items only.

## DO NOT TOUCH
- `LOOP-MAIL-ARCHIVER-MICROSOFT-DEEP-IMPORT-20260226`
- `GAP-OP-973`
- Any EWS import lane
- Any MD1400 rsync/capacity lane
- Files directly scoped to active protected lanes, including:
  - `mailroom/state/loop-scopes/LOOP-MAIL-ARCHIVER-MICROSOFT-DEEP-IMPORT-20260226.scope.md`
  - `docs/planning/MD1400_*`

## Guardrails
- Single orchestrator terminal flow.
- No VM, infra, or runtime destructive actions.
- No force push.
- No branch deletion before snapshot bundle creation.
- No secret values in logs, commits, receipts, or console output.
