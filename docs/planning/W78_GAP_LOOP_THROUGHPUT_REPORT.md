wave_id: W78_TRUTH_FIRST_RELIABILITY_HARDENING_20260228

## Loop Throughput

- loops_closed_count: 0
- loops_closed_list: none
- rationale: W78 scoped to truth-first reliability hardening and gating parity; no eligible zero-gap loop was force-closed in this wave.

## Gap Throughput

- gaps_fixed_or_closed_count: 0
- gaps_fixed_or_closed_list: none
- gaps_opened_count: 1
- gaps_opened_list:
