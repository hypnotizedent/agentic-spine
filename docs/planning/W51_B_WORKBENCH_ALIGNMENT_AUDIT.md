## Undocumented Artifacts

### High Priority (Active Operations)

| Artifact | Location | Risk |
|----------|----------|------|
| deploy/stack-map.sh | scripts/root/deploy/ | HIGH - Deployment critical |
| Multiple root scripts | scripts/root/ | MEDIUM - Operational |

### Medium Priority (Supporting Operations)

| Artifact | Location | Risk |
|----------|----------|------|
| infrastructure scripts | scripts/infrastructure/ | MEDIUM |

## Alignment with Spine

### Capability Coverage

| Workbench Script | Spine Capability | Alignment |
|------------------|------------------|-----------|
| smoke-test.sh | services.health.status | DUPLICATE |
| backup-*.sh | backup.* capabilities | PARTIAL |
| finance sync scripts | finance.* capabilities | PARTIAL |

### Recommended Actions

1. **Consolidate smoke-test.sh** → Use `services.health.status` capability
2. **Document deploy/stack-map.sh** → Add to CAPABILITIES_INDEX.md
3. **Review backup scripts** → Migrate to spine capabilities
