## surfaces/

- Verification surfaces executed by `./bin/ops verify` and `./bin/ops cap run spine.verify`.
- Primary location: `surfaces/verify/` (72 drift/health scripts; orchestrated by `drift-gate.sh`).
- Index and caller mapping: `docs/governance/VERIFY_SURFACE_INDEX.md`.
- No other surfaces are active; add new surfaces only with index + drift-gate wiring.
