# fixtures/n8n/

Pointer surface only.

Canonical n8n workflow exports moved to workbench:

- `/Users/ronnyworks/code/workbench/infra/compose/n8n/workflows/`
- `/Users/ronnyworks/code/workbench/infra/compose/n8n/workflows/snapshots/`

Spine keeps this README as a route hint; workflow JSON artifacts are workbench-owned.
