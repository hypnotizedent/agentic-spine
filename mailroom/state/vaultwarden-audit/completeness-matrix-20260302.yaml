# Vaultwarden Canonical Audit — Completeness Matrix
# W1: Data completeness audit (export vs live vault)

audit_id: VW-AUDIT-20260302
wave: W1

comparison_methodology:
  source: "Phone export (bitwarden_export_20260301212334.json)"
  target: "Live vault (INACCESSIBLE — VM 204 down)"
  comparison_mode: "source-only with historical cross-reference"
  historical_reference: "Feb 25 recovery promotion audit (448 live items)"
  limitation: >
    Live vault is unreachable. Completeness comparison is approximate,
    based on the Feb 25 audit baseline (448 items) and the known
    Mar 1 backfill event (39 items reported created, 0 errors).

  note: >
    The phone export represents vault state as of ~Feb 15 (last sync).
    The backfill on Mar 1 is NOT reflected in this export. Both export
    files (Feb 25 and Mar 01 timestamps) are byte-identical, confirming
    the phone cache was stale.

  possible_explanations:
    - "8 items were in the phone cache but not yet synced to the live vault at Feb 25 audit time"
    - "Or: 8 items were added to the vault between the phone's last sync and the Feb 25 audit, and the phone synced them"
    - "Without live access, cannot determine which explanation is correct"
