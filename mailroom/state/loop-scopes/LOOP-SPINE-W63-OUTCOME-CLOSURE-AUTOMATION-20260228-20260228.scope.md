# Loop Scope: LOOP-SPINE-W63-OUTCOME-CLOSURE-AUTOMATION-20260228-20260228

## Objective

Automate deterministic fix-verify-close flow for loops and linked gaps with freshness reconciliation and outcome SLO probes

## Phases
- Step 1:  Implement closure and freshness primitives
- Step 2:  Run outcome verification and reconcile
- Step 3:  Execute end-to-end loop closeout attempts

## Success Criteria
- Primary acceptance checks pass with deterministic evidence

## Definition Of Done
- Scope artifacts updated and committed.
- Receipted verification run keys recorded.
- Loop status can be moved to closed.
