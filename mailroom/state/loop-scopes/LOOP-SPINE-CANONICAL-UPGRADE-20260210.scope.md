# Loop Scope: LOOP-SPINE-CANONICAL-UPGRADE-20260210

## Goal
- Hardening and consolidation of spine canon (brief surfaces, scaffold generation, capability discovery).

## Success Criteria
- CLAUDE.md duplication resolved without breaking D46/D65.
- SPINE_SCAFFOLD generated from contracts to remove manual drift.
- Capability surface gains tag/index for discovery.

## Phases
- P0 scope capture (draft).
- P1 design + approvals (deferred).
- P2 implementation (deferred).

## Receipts
- (link receipts when executed)

## Deferred / Follow-ups
- Coordinate with governance to update D46/D65 expectations before CLAUDE.md removal.
