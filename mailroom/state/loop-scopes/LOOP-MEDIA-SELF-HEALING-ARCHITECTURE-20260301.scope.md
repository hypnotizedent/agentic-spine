# Loop Scope: LOOP-MEDIA-SELF-HEALING-ARCHITECTURE-20260301

## Objective

Wire media domain into recovery dispatch, add monitoring, and close governance gaps for autonomous media stack health

## Phases
- Step 1:  loop and gaps capture
- Step 2:  recovery and observability wiring
- Step 3:  governance hardening and closure

## Success Criteria
- Media verify pack includes D303/D304 and passes
- Recovery dispatch handles media deterministic failures
- All scoped media gaps closed

## Definition Of Done
- Scope artifacts updated and committed.
- Receipted verification run keys recorded.
- Loop status can be moved to closed.
