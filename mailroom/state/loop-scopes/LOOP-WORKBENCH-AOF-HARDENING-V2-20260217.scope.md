## Workstreams

1. Checker determinism and explainability
2. Proposal-apply preflight robustness
3. Contract versioning/cutoff/exception semantics
4. Compose/secrets hardening ratchets
5. Operational cadence and certification template

## Activation Rule

Set status to `active` after:
1. Plan review/approval
2. Scope confirmation with current proposal queue state
3. Initial baseline run of workbench checker (`--mode all`) passes
