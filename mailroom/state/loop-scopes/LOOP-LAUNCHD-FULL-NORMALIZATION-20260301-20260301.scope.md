# Loop Scope: LOOP-LAUNCHD-FULL-NORMALIZATION-20260301-20260301

## Objective

Normalize launchd runtime to one governed registry/contract/template set with zero orphan labels, canonical log/env standards, and health coverage parity.

## Phases
- Step 1:  registry and scope baseline
- Step 2:  orphan/template parity + security normalization
- Step 3:  contract/health/gate parity and closure

## Success Criteria
- All active com.ronny launchd labels represented by governed templates and contract coverage.
- No plaintext bridge tokens in live launchd plists; log paths normalized to mailroom/logs for spine-managed labels.
- D148 core parity passes with updated required label set and runtime sync evidence.

## Definition Of Done
- Scope artifacts updated and committed.
- Receipted verification run keys recorded.
- Loop status can be moved to closed.
