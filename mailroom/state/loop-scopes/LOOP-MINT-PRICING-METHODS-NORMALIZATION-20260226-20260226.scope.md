# Loop Scope: LOOP-MINT-PRICING-METHODS-NORMALIZATION-20260226-20260226

## Objective

Define canonical decision-backed normalization contracts for embroidery, engraving, and transfers pricing dimensions before any new pricing E2E rollout.

## Steps
- Step 0: Loop+gap registration
- Step 1: Method-level evidence and decision contract drafting
- Step 2: E2E readiness gating after human decisions

## Success Criteria
- All human-decision pricing method gaps filed and linked
- Method decision draft and readiness matrix published
- Explicit DO NOT START E2E gate until decision gaps close

## Definition Of Done
- Scope artifacts updated and committed.
- Receipted verification run keys recorded.
- Loop status can be moved to closed.
