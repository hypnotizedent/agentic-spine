# Loop Scope: LOOP-SPINE-W74-FINAL-CLOSEOUT-BRANCH-ZERO-20260228-20260228-20260228

## Objective

Final closeout sweep: loop closure and branch backlog classification with deterministic receipts

## Phases
- Step 1:  Baseline state capture
- Step 2:  Eligible loop closeout
- Step 3:  Branch backlog classification and delete plan
- Step 4:  Verify and parity closeout

## Success Criteria
- Branch-zero closeout artifacts complete and parity proven

## Definition Of Done
- No orphaned gaps introduced; protected lanes untouched
