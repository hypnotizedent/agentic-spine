# Loop Scope: LOOP-ENTRYCHAIN-SCAFFOLD-REFRESH-20260210

## Source
- Certification report: mailroom/outbox/audit-export/2026-02-10-full-certification.md

## Goal
Refresh SPINE_SCAFFOLD.md and the entry chain docs to match current canonical paths, gates, and capabilities.

## Success Criteria
- Scope doc is clean (no injected command output).
- Next actions are clear and bounded.
- Closeout uses receipts when changes land.

## Phases
- P0: Triage + decision + inventory
- P1: Implement updates (SSOT/bindings/docs)
- P2: Verify (gates + targeted checks)
- P3: Closeout (receipts + loop closure)

## Next Action
Reconcile SPINE_SCAFFOLD.md with current canonical paths and session entry steps; identify deltas from the certification report and open loops.

## Evidence (Receipts)
- mailroom/outbox/audit-export/2026-02-10-full-certification.md
