# Loop Scope: LOOP-SPINE-W61-CAPABILITY-ERGONOMICS-NORMALIZATION-20260228

## Objective

Reduce agent friction in cap operations: capability flag discoverability, mode auto-injection patterns, shell compatibility pitfalls, and sequential call overhead for gap filing.

## Steps
- Step 1: verify and group capability-ergonomics findings
- Step 2: implement cap UX normalization and lockable standards
- Step 3: benchmark and certify reduced friction path

## Success Criteria
- cap show exposes actionable flag/mode guidance for high-friction capabilities
- batch/sequential gaps.file overhead reduced or governed with explicit fast path

## Definition Of Done
- Capability UX contract and evidence report committed
- Regression lock(s) added for cap UX drift
