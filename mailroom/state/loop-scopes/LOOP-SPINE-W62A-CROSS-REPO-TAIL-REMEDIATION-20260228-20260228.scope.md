# Loop Scope: LOOP-SPINE-W62A-CROSS-REPO-TAIL-REMEDIATION-20260228-20260228

## Objective

Close cross-repo remediation tail with deterministic acceptance evidence before promotion.

## Phases
- Step 1:  apply cross-repo remediation
- Step 2:  run deterministic acceptance validator
- Step 3:  verify receipts and merge-ready closeout

## Success Criteria
- All W62-A deterministic checks pass
- No protected lane mutation

## Definition Of Done
- Scope artifacts updated and committed.
- Receipted verification run keys recorded.
- Loop status can be moved to closed.
