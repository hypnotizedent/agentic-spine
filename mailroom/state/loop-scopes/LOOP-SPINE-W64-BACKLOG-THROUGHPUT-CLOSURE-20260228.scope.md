# Loop Scope: LOOP-SPINE-W64-BACKLOG-THROUGHPUT-CLOSURE-20260228

## Objective

Close ready non-protected loops and linked gaps using deterministic closure primitive

## Phases
- Step 1: capture and classify findings
- Step 2: implement changes
- Step 3: verify and close out

## Success Criteria
- All linked gaps/proposals are captured and linked to this loop.
- Relevant verify pack(s) pass.

## Definition Of Done
- Scope artifacts updated and committed.
- Receipted verification run keys recorded.
- Loop status can be moved to closed.
