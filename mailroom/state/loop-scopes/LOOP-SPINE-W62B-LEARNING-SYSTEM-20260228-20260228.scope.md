# Loop Scope: LOOP-SPINE-W62B-LEARNING-SYSTEM-20260228-20260228

## Objective

Implement W62-B learning-system scoring, recommendations, SLO reporting, and verify interface hardening with deterministic receipts

## Phases
- Step 1:  Implement learning-system outputs
- Step 2:  Run deterministic verification
- Step 3:  Emit receipts and parity evidence

## Success Criteria
- All W62B acceptance rows pass with evidence

## Definition Of Done
- Scope artifacts updated and committed.
- Receipted verification run keys recorded.
- Loop status can be moved to closed.
