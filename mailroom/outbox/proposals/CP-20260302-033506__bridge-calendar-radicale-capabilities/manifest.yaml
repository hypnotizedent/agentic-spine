summary: |
  Enable bridge calendar capabilities for Radicale CalDAV operations.
  
  The spine bridge currently has read-only /calendar/feed and /calendar/today HTTP
  endpoints but no Cap-RPC access to calendar event manipulation capabilities.
  
  Calendar.home.event.* capabilities already exist for local Radicale operations:
  - calendar.home.event.create
  - calendar.home.event.list  
  - calendar.home.event.get
  - calendar.home.event.update
  - calendar.home.event.delete
  
  This proposal:
  1. Registers the gap (GAP-OP-1336)
  2. Creates a loop scope for the implementation work
  3. Defines the required changes to bridge Cap-RPC allowlist
  
  Bridge will gain ability to execute calendar operations via POST /cap/run
  with CF Access + spine token auth pattern (already established).
