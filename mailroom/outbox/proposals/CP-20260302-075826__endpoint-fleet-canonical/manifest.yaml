notes: |
  This proposal defines the canonical 3-tier endpoint fleet model:
  
  - Tier 1: Departmental Mini PC (Beelink EQ13 N100) - 3 units for press/production/front-office
  - Tier 2: Static Display Pi (Raspberry Pi 5 1GB) - 2 units for passive camera displays
  - Tier 3: Manager Compute Workstation (Ryzen 9 8945HS) - 1 unit for design/print management
  
  Total initial fleet: 6 machines at shop location.
  
  This planning work creates the governance framework. Execution (hardware purchase, provisioning) 
  happens in future loops after approval.
