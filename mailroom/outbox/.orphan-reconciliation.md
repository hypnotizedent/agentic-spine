# Orphaned Outbox Reconciliation

> Generated: 2026-02-13
> Purpose: Document outbox files not tracked by mailroom/state/ledger.csv

## Standalone Audit Artifacts (Not Run Results)

These files are audit/analysis outputs placed directly in outbox, not produced by the mailroom run engine:

- FINANCE_PARITY_ACTION_PACK_20260212.md (.csv companion)
- MEDIA_STACK_RCA_PHASE_A_RETROSPECTIVE.md
- PHASE4_OBSERVABILITY_RETROSPECTIVE.md

## Orphaned Result Files

These RESULT files exist in mailroom/outbox/ but have no corresponding entry in the ledger's result_file column:

- `0001_RESULT.md` — seed/test result (pre-dates ledger tracking)
- `9001_RESULT.md` — seed/test result (pre-dates ledger tracking)
- `9999_RESULT.md` — seed/test result (pre-dates ledger tracking)
- `KERNEL_HARDEN_CONTRACTS_20260203__RESULT.md` — early manual run, no ledger row
- `KERNEL_HARDEN_CONTRACTS_20260203_003933__RESULT.md` — early manual run, no ledger row
- `S20260201-173900__unified-test__R8888__RESULT.md` — unified test harness output, pre-ledger
- `S20260201-180000__email_received__R0001__RESULT.md` — seed signal test, pre-ledger
- `S20260201-180100__order_paid__R0002__RESULT.md` — seed signal test, pre-ledger
- `S20260201-180200__vendor_receipt__R0003__RESULT.md` — seed signal test, pre-ledger
- `S20260201-180300__file_uploaded__R0004__RESULT.md` — seed signal test, pre-ledger
- `S20260201-180400__unknown_event__R0005__RESULT.md` — seed signal test, pre-ledger
- `S20260201-180640__inline__R04v833909__RESULT.md` — early inline run, pre-ledger
- `S20260201-182053__inline__R76zq36073__RESULT.md` — early inline run, pre-ledger

## Notes

All 13 orphaned result files pre-date the ledger's earliest entry (2026-02-02). They are artifacts from initial mailroom development and testing. No data loss — the ledger was introduced after these runs were created.
