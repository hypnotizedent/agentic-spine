  D291:
    title: gate-budget-add-one-retire-one-lock
    mode: enforce
    eligibility: eligible
    rationale: "Deterministic policy check with zero current violations; safe to enforce."
    rollback: "Set SPINE_ENFORCEMENT_MODE=report-only for immediate non-blocking behavior."

  D4:
    title: watcher
    mode: report-only
    eligibility: deferred
    rationale: "Inline deep-ring watcher signal depends on workstation-specific launch agent state and remains advisory."
    rollback: "N/A (already report-only)."
