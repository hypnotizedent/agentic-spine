      Agent guessed path ~/stacks/infisical/ instead of consulting
      docker.compose.targets.yaml binding first. SSOT had the correct
      path (~/stacks/secrets). This is a pattern issue, not a data issue.

    doc: "ops/bindings/infra.placement.policy.yaml"
    description: |
      Canonical infra-core/observability services were intended for shop Proxmox
      (pve) but relocation commands relied on manifest values without a
      canonical site/hypervisor placement lock. This allowed wrong-instance
      execution risk when target metadata drifted.
    severity: high
    status: fixed

    doc: "ops/bindings/ssh.targets.yaml"
    description: |
      Hypervisor SSH target IDs are distinct (`pve`, `proxmox-home`) but runtime
      host identity is ambiguous: `proxmox-home` currently reports hostname `pve`.
      This creates decision-risk during relocation/provisioning because agents and
      operators can confuse shop/home hypervisors.
    severity: high
    status: fixed
    fixed_in: "LOOP-GOV-SPINE-SEAL-20260207"
    notes: |
      Guardrail added: infra.hypervisor.identity capability + mutating infra
      preconditions now fail on hostname/machine-id ambiguity. Host-level fix
      applied: proxmox-home canonical hostname updated from `pve` to
      `proxmox-home` via capability `infra.hypervisor.hostname.set`
      (receipt: RCAP-20260207-113039__infra.hypervisor.hostname.set__Rxrbe80548).

    doc: "ops/plugins/infra/bin/infra-relocation-preflight"
    description: |
      Preflight host scan silently skipped service source hosts because it used
      an invalid yq expression (`.services[].from_host // empty`) and suppressed
      parser errors. The command also reported missing SSH targets/unreachable
      hosts as informational output instead of a failing gate, allowing
      decision flow to continue without required host evidence.
    severity: high
    status: fixed
    fixed_in: "LOOP-GOV-SPINE-SEAL-20260207"
    notes: |
      Fixed by correcting host extraction, deriving required hosts from active
      VM/service states, and enforcing hard failure on required host/SSOT
      mismatches.

    doc: "ops/plugins/infra/bin/infra-relocation-service-transition"
    description: |
      Service and relocation state transitions allowed out-of-order decision
      updates (cutover/migrated) with warning-only behavior. This permitted
      metadata progression even when relocation state had not reached cutover.
    severity: medium
    status: fixed
    fixed_in: "LOOP-GOV-SPINE-SEAL-20260207"
    notes: |
      Transition scripts now hard-fail when relocation state and service/vm
      status are misaligned, and cutover state transition includes an execute-time
      vm readiness gate.

    description: |
      Top-level `spine.verify` can pass while `infra.hypervisor.identity` fails.
      During active relocation this produces a green global health signal even
      when hypervisor identity ambiguity remains unresolved.
    severity: high
    status: fixed
    fixed_in: "LOOP-GOV-SPINE-SEAL-20260207"
    notes: |
      Added D39 gate (`surfaces/verify/d39-infra-hypervisor-identity-lock.sh`)
      and wired it into `drift-gate.sh`. During active relocation states,
      `spine.verify` now fails if hypervisor identity invariants are violated.
