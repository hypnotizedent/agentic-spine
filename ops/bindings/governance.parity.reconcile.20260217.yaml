decisions:
  - id: GOV-PARITY-01
    area: backup-governance-location
    decision: accept
    rationale: "Backup governance remains canonical in workbench domain docs; spine keeps pointer-only surface."
    action: "Maintain docs/governance/BACKUP_GOVERNANCE.md pointer to workbench authority path."

  - id: GOV-PARITY-02
    area: backup-tier-language
    decision: reject
    rationale: "Legacy numeric tier table conflicts with current binding-driven classification contract."
    action: "Use ops/bindings/backup.inventory.yaml classifications as runtime authority."

  - id: GOV-PARITY-03
    area: reboot-hard-stop-checks
    decision: accept
    rationale: "Legacy STOP checks are still operationally valid and reduce reboot risk."
    action: "Merged into docs/governance/REBOOT_HEALTH_GATE.md Hard Stop Conditions section."

  - id: GOV-PARITY-04
    area: reboot-vm-state-diagnostic
    decision: accept
    rationale: "Prevents false network incident diagnosis when VM is intentionally stopped."
    action: "Added runtime-state check note to post-reboot section."

  - id: GOV-PARITY-05
    area: ssot-registry-path-mapping
    decision: accept
    rationale: "Spine path migration from docs/runbooks to docs/governance is intentional and canonical."
    action: "Retain backup/reboot SSOT entries in docs/governance/SSOT_REGISTRY.yaml."

  - id: GOV-PARITY-06
    area: ssot-scope-boundary
    decision: reject
    rationale: "Legacy registry contained non-spine ownership surfaces that would reintroduce dual authority."
    action: "Keep scope-limited spine registry and maintain removed-entry rationale comments."
