# Agent Rules
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

agent_rules:
  - "When adding a new host/VM: update BOTH ssh.targets.yaml (spine) AND tailscale.conf (workbench)"
  - "When migrating a service: update spine bindings FIRST, then sync workbench data files"
  - "When workbench and spine disagree: spine wins (except for SSH runtime config)"
  - "Never create new governance bindings in workbench — governance lives in spine"
  - "Workbench compose files are reference/legacy — live truth is on the target host"
