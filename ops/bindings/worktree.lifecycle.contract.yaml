messages:
  remediation: "Use wave/loop lifecycle closeout before git cleanup. Prefer `./bin/ops cap run worktree.lifecycle.reconcile -- --json` to classify stale branches, then perform explicit close actions."
  gate_summary: "D48 enforces lifecycle violations only (closed-owner zombies, detached heads, non-local orphan branches, stale merged branches, stale unowned locals)."
