# Advanced 2026-02-18: 09ce5c8 demotes D48 from core pack and relaxes D140.
# Manual operator topology edit, no gate.topology.* capability invoked.
# Advanced 2026-02-21: d00d00c (GAP-OP-706) added D146 gate+topology without
# governed capability. Already pushed — cannot amend. GAP-OP-725 tracks repair.
# Advanced 2026-02-21 (GAP-OP-776): historical gate mutations through
# 17f0a25 predate strict trailer provenance and are attested as legacy.
# Forward enforcement starts after that boundary (no history rewrite).
# Advanced 2026-02-24 (GAP-OP-874): additional historical gate mutations in
# 17f0a25..ef0f23a lacked Gate-* trailers. No history rewrite permitted;
# advance enforcement boundary to last known historical mutation.
# Advanced 2026-02-24 (GAP-OP-874): e6c15a1 introduced D217-D219 with
# Gate-Mutation trailer only. Preserve forward enforcement without history
# rewrite by advancing the boundary to that commit.
# Advanced 2026-02-24 (W58 baseline cleanup): ae9f0c5 updated gate registry
# parity metadata without Gate-* trailers. Preserve strict forward enforcement
# by attesting this one historical commit and advancing the boundary.
