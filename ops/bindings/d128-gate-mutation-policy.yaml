# Advanced 2026-02-18: 09ce5c8 demotes D48 from core pack and relaxes D140.
# Manual operator topology edit, no gate.topology.* capability invoked.
# Advanced 2026-02-21: d00d00c (GAP-OP-706) added D146 gate+topology without
# governed capability. Already pushed — cannot amend. GAP-OP-725 tracks repair.
# Advanced 2026-02-21 (GAP-OP-776): historical gate mutations through
# 17f0a25 predate strict trailer provenance and are attested as legacy.
# Forward enforcement starts after that boundary (no history rewrite).
