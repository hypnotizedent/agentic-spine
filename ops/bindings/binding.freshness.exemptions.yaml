# Binding Freshness Exemptions
#
# These binding files are inventory/index style: they contain lists of entries
# where each entry carries its own timestamps or context. The top-level
# `updated:` field reflects the last time any entry changed, not the freshness
# of the policy itself. They are exempt from D58 binding staleness checks.
#
# Normative bindings (policies, allowlists, schemas) are NOT exempt and must
# maintain fresh `updated:` dates.
