# Startup Sequencing Binding (SSOT)
# Non-secret. Spine-native.
# Status: authoritative
# Last verified: 2026-02-25
#
# Declares the correct startup order for hosts and stacks after a power cycle.
# Used by infra.post_power.recovery and infra.maintenance.window capabilities.
#
# Rules:
#   - Hosts start in phase order (lower = earlier)
#   - Within a host, stacks start in declared order
#   - Health probes run after each phase to confirm readiness
#   - docker-host is last because its services depend on infra-core (tunnel, DNS)
#   - Each phase has a site tag (shop|home) for site-scoped maintenance
#
# Sites:
#   shop  — Dell R730XD (pve), all production VMs (200-214, excluding 201 destroyed)
#   home  — Beelink SER7 (proxmox-home), HA VM (100), NAS
#
# VM ordering is authoritative in the shop_vm_lifecycle / home_vm_lifecycle keys below.
# Do NOT rely on comment-parsing for VM lists.

# ── Authoritative VM lifecycle lists ──────────────────────────────────────────
# These are the SSOT for which VMs exist on each site and their startup/shutdown order.
# infra.proxmox.maintenance reads these keys at runtime.
#
# Rules:
#   - startup_order: VMs start in this order (infra-first, legacy-last)
#   - shutdown_order: reverse of startup, with exceptions noted
#   - destroyed/template VMs are excluded from both lists
#   - VMs not in the ordered list are treated as "unordered" (started/stopped last)
