# Directories explicitly excluded from terminal role ownership.
# No terminal claims write authority over these paths.
# They are not governed by drift gates or verify lanes.
excluded_surfaces:
  - path: fixtures/
    rationale: "Test fixtures and sample data. Not operator or system truth."
  - path: .archive/
    rationale: "Archived artifacts from prior spine iterations. Read-only reference, not active governance."
  - path: .planning/
    rationale: "Ephemeral planning scratch space. Not committed to governance contracts."
