# Status: authoritative
# Last verified: 2026-02-24
# Scope: domain-environment-boundary-v1
#
# Purpose:
#   Agent-readable SSOT for the 3 business environments.
#   Maps domains to repos, email/cloud providers, and data boundaries.
#   Agents use this to determine which environment a domain belongs to
#   and what constraints apply when operating on domain-scoped work.

environments:
  mint:
    label: "Mint (work)"
    domains: [mintprints.com, mintprints.co]
    repo: /code/mint-modules
    email_provider: microsoft-365
    cloud_provider: azure
    boundary: "mint work only — no spine, no personal data"
    notes: "These domains and Microsoft Azure resources are exclusively for the mint-modules environment."

  ronny:
    label: "Ronny (personal + consulting + homeservices)"
    domains: [ronny.works, hantash.com]
    repo: /code/agentic-spine
    email_provider:
      ronny.works: stalwart (spine.ronny.works)
      hantash.com: icloud
    cloud_provider: none (spine-native)
    boundary: "everything outside mint-modules — personal, consulting, family, homelab"
    notes: "ronny.works runs 25+ self-hosted services. hantash.com is iCloud custom domain for personal/family email."

  hypno:
    label: "Hypnotized (venture — dormant)"
    domains: [hypnotizedclothing.com, hypnotized.clothing, hypnotized.design]
    repo: /code/hypno
    email_provider: none
    cloud_provider: none
    boundary: "venture brand — dormant until mint-modules stable"
    notes: "Full brand. Domains parked, will activate after mint-modules is stable. Legacy Shopify DNS (hypnotized-2.myshopify.com) still in place — not operational."

platform:
  cloudflare:
    role: canonical
    scope: "registrar + DNS + tunnel + access + pages"
    notes: "Centerpoint for all website, DNS, and internet-facing infrastructure."
  namecheap:
    role: deprecated
    scope: "purchase-only fallback for TLDs unsupported by Cloudflare Registrar"
    notes: "All domains transferring to Cloudflare. No operational dependency remains after transfers complete."
  infisical:
    role: canonical
    scope: "secrets management"
  shopify:
    role: integration-channel
    scope: "inbound order channel for mint-modules customers (NOT our own storefront)"
    notes: >
      Shopify is an external ecommerce platform that Mint customers sell on.
      Mint acts as production partner (like Printful/Printify) — customers on Shopify
      route production orders to mint-modules. Legacy OAuth routes exist in mint-os
      (mintprintsfl.myshopify.com, scopes: read_content,write_content). No mint-modules
      integration built yet. Credentials in Infisical (infrastructure/prod).
      hypnotized-2.myshopify.com is a separate legacy store for the dormant Hypnotized brand.
