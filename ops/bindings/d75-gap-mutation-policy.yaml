description: >
  Enforces capability-only mutation evidence for the gap registry.
  Direct manual edits bypass the claim + git-lock workflow.
  D75 detects uncommitted changes and commits lacking required trailers.
file: ops/bindings/operational.gaps.yaml

# Number of recent commits touching the file to inspect.
window: 50

# Commits before this SHA are exempt (pre-enforcement baseline).
# Advanced 2026-02-15: operator restructuring (re-parent GAP-OP-308,
# link parent_loop for 321-323, 324-328) — capability system lacks re-parent support.

# Required git trailers in commit messages that touch the registry.
required_trailers:
  - Gap-Mutation
  - Gap-Capability
  - Gap-Run-Key

# Limitation: governance evidence only, not cryptographic tamper-proofing.
# A determined actor with direct git access can forge trailers.
# D75 prevents accidental manual edits, not intentional circumvention.
