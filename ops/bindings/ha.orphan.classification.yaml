# HA Orphan Device Classification
# Status: authoritative
# Last verified: 2026-02-15
#
# Classifies HA devices that don't belong to a physical area.
# These are not "orphans" in the broken sense — they're correctly
# unassigned because they have no physical location.
#
# Categories:
#   hacs-plugin       — HACS frontend card/theme (Lovelace UI component)
#   hacs-integration  — HACS custom integration (backend component)
#   native-integration — Built-in HA integration (weather, sun, etc.)
#   system-internal    — HA core system component (OS, supervisor, backup)
#   mobile-app         — Phone/watch via HA Companion App
#   needs-registry     — Physical device that SHOULD be in device registry + assigned to area
#
# Devices in "needs-registry" are action items — they need area assignment
# and possibly an entry in home.device.registry.yaml.
