# HA Orphan Device Classification
# Status: authoritative
# Last verified: 2026-02-16
# Consumed by: ha-device-map-build (name-based lookup, case-insensitive)
#
# Classifies orphan devices in ha.device.map.yaml — devices with no match
# to home.device.registry.yaml (by MAC/name) or z2m.devices.yaml (by IEEE).
#
# Categories:
#   native-integration — Built-in HA integration (weather, sun, prayer times)
#   system-internal    — HA core component (backup, HACS, Z2M bridge)
#   mobile-app         — Phone/watch via Companion App (no fixed area)
#   nas-subsystem      — NAS drives/volumes/caches (children of synology918)
#   media-device       — TVs, speakers, streaming boxes (matched by integration)
#   smart-appliance    — Vacuums, purifiers, curtain robots, feeders
#   smart-plug         — TP-Link/Kasa plugs and energy monitors
#   smart-bulb         — WiFi bulbs controlled via Local Tuya or native integration
#   needs-registry     — Physical device NOT in device registry (action item)
#
# "needs-registry" devices require: area assignment + home.device.registry.yaml entry.
# All other categories are informational — no action needed.
